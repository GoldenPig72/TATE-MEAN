# TATE-MEAN Cloud Development Project

This project is part of our Agile Coach Team's attempts to deploy a MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack on a cloud platform (in this case Heroku) so that we can learn the ins and outs of actual cloud developing and deployment.

You can find out all about it in our corporate [wiki](https://km3.capgemini.com/wiki/tate-school-devops) (not open to non-company folk).
