# TATE-MEAN

This project is part of our Agile Coach Team's attempts to deploy a MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack on a cloud platform (in this case Heroku) so that we can learn the ins and outs of actual cloud developing and deployment.

This document will contain the instructions for new members joining the team to get up and running with the local environments and with access to the necessary repositories and cloud platforms.
